<!-- -------->If I counted the times I have been called Angry
<!-- -------->Bossy
<!-- -------->Mean
<!-- -------->Or scary
<!-- -------->In my lifetime, I would start to hate me
<!-- -------->Where single strokes paint the colors of my new key
<!-- -------->To a reality predestined for me
<!-- -------->Where queens are all white and
<!-- -------->and black is just the unwanted stain
<!-- -------->that gets left out during winter's harshest rain’s
<!-- -------->and feels every word of hate you spill into Black’s colonized brain
<!-- -------->Black has curly roots that reaches deep into dark black ink
<!-- -------->When you comb out each kink
<!-- -------->It turns out ever so poofier than your wildest dreams
<!-- -------->Where no matter how many times you try to be like them
<!-- -------->You push yourself into a constructed false reality
<!-- -------->Where no matter how many times you swear the cream will erase away the black
<!-- -------->You never admit to never being able to change the colors God gave you
<!-- -------->God gave you a base
<!-- -------->A base so deep everything you entertain falls in the mercy of your kingdom
<!-- -------->A base so deep it stores all the pain and turns it into wisdom
<!-- -------->It piles up before the clouds ever gets the chance to read its deep melody
<!-- -------->Before your melanin gets the chance to sing
<!-- -------->A song called Beauty
<!-- -------->A song that sings about your kingdom
<!-- -------->How your voice is history enough
<!-- -------->And every sound deserves an orchestra at its feet
<!-- -------->In your kingdom, you'll finally be the standard
<!-- -------->In your kingdom, you will finally be excellence
<!-- -------->Your feet will stomp the old freedom spiritual
<!-- -------->Your legs will be as wavy as the dark waters of your passage
<!-- -------->Your torso will sink as deep as the beat that recites what it means to be a woman
<!-- -------->Your chin will rise above the skyscrapers that corporate America used to block your sun
<!-- -------->the skyscrapers that corporate America used to erase your sun
<!-- -------->your eyes will see through the stories of every black girl who's not good enough
<!-- -------->Your ears will hear the resonating rings that started 4 score and 7 years ago
<!-- -------->And your arms will extend out showing your battle scars
<!-- -------->Your tissue that hangs thin at expectations of beauty
<!-- -------->they will hang like the feathers of the most exotic bird
<!-- -------->They will scream this is what pain looks like
<!-- -------->They will wail this is what America looks like
<!-- -------->This is what it means to strike back at the bleached hands of expectation
<!-- -------->This must be how it feels to reacquire power in this infestation
<!-- -------->My black will continue to exhilarate the bright future that is my tomorrow
<!-- -------->It will suffocate the shackles you have inscribed with sorrow
<!-- -------->It will stand up
<!-- -------->Reach
<!-- -------->Quiver at the freedom of regaining touch
<!-- -------->And your hands
<!-- -------->Your hands
<!-- -------->will be able to write their own history
<!-- -------->This it what it finally means to feel
<!-- -------->Now let's start to listen
